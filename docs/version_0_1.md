## Milestone to v0.1 (_Lay down the basics_)

I should be able to move within a 3D world, pick and place objects, open and close doors. Have triggerable buttons. etc.
Character should have a basic gun that shoots tennis balls. I should be able to shoot a shooting targets, that fall over once hit.

### Priorities
1. Transform hierarchies, and transform editing
2. Joints 
3. Etc.

### Physics
- [x] Basic, parametric, character controller
- [ ] Hinge joint component with limits and motor drive
- [ ] Hard physics joint
- [ ] Trigger shape component

### Behaviour
- [ ] Door activation behaviour
- [ ] Trigger shape behaviour
- [ ] Basic scripting behaviour prototype

### Editor
- [ ] Transform gizmo having selectable targets (Transform, Joint pivot, Joint axis)
  - [ ] Transform getter/setter for the Joint component
  - [ ] Transform getter/setter for camera component
  - [x] UI Transform gizmo helper class

### General
- [ ] Relative transform for camera 
- [ ] Relative transforms (assign parent transform component)
- [ ] Basic animation component (animates transform, position and rotation)

### Rendering
- [ ] Overlay cross-hair
- [ ] Static decals
- [ ] Shadow-map improvements
- [ ] Fix reflection probes
